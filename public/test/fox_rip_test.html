				EX-NFL STAR EXPOSES SIMPLE 2-STEP TRICK TO HIS SHOCKING BODY TRANSFORMATION

					"I felt like it was time for older men around the globe to know about this silly trick."
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				Our readers are often curious how men over 40 manage to keep themselves in shape despite declining metabolism and low levels of testosterone. So this past month, staff reporter Adam Delaney and I flew out to Los Angeles to speak with ex-NFL superstar Joe Jarvis.
				<br><br>
				After a long career in the NFL, Joe transitioned into senior bodybuilding. "It was no easy task; at my age it's hard enough staying in shape, let alone be pushed to look better than you did in your 20's!" To our surprise, he filled us in on two supplements that he claims have been vital to his increase in muscle growth and increased energy. 
				<br><br>
				The first supplement is <a href="http://tracking.strongerliving.org/click/1">Ripped Muscle X</a> - “Monster Pills” as the athletes commonly refer to them. They are reportedly helping men put on up to 5+ pounds of muscle per week, with little to no change to their daily routines. The second supplement, <a href="http://tracking.strongerliving.org/click/2">Elite Test 360</a>, is used to boost testosterone levels and burn fat while you sleep.
				<br><br>
				At FSN we know that putting on muscle often feels like an impossible challenge. We've evaluated numerous fad muscle programs and the two things they always have in common is a high price tag and disappointing results. In this special report, we take an in-depth look at a new and promising trend that we think is easy to use and yields real results.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Here are a few user-submitted photos that we had to share with our readers. The results have been startling:</strong>
				<br><br>
				</p><p><a href="http://tracking.strongerliving.org/click/1"></a></p><p><a href="http://tracking.strongerliving.org/click/1"><img src="./fox_rip_test_files/ba1.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

				<a href="http://tracking.strongerliving.org/click/1"><p><img src="./fox_rip_test_files/ba4.jpg" width="300"></p></a>
				<p></p>

				<br><br>
				<p>Ripped Muscle X's high anti-oxidant content and powerful strength gaining properties make it a muscle-building machine. Combine Ripped Muscle X with Elite Test 360 and you've can achieve the holy grail of muscle gains with simultaneous fat losses.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>If you're feeling skeptical right now, you're not alone. When we first learned about this fat-burning/muscle-building combo our fad radar went off right away. But despite our initial doubts about <a href="http://tracking.strongerliving.org/click/1">Ripped Muscle X</a>, the countless success stories reported in Hollywood made us take a second look at this trend. What particularly interested us was the fact that people saw results without significant changes to diet or lifestyle.</p>
			<p></p>

			<p>
				At FSN, we decided to try <a href="http://tracking.strongerliving.org/click/1">Ripped Muscle X</a> and <a href="http://tracking.strongerliving.org/click/2">Elite Test 360</a> for ourselves. For the test, I wanted to be the guinea pig because I was training to be in a fitness competition and needed to slim down while simultaneously building lean muscle. After further research into the manufacturer I was confident that these supplements were safe and contained especially high concentrations of the proprietary muscle building extract. To finally get my hands on <a href="http://tracking.strongerliving.org/click/1">Ripped Muscle X</a> and <a href="http://tracking.strongerliving.org/click/2">Elite Test 360</a> stack, I ordered free trials of both products. Everyone at FSN was incredibly excited about these products and eagerly awaiting my results.
				<br><br>
				The free trial bottle of Ripped Muscle X arrived in a few days-all I paid was a few dollars for shipping and handling.

						Ripped Muscle X

					When combined with Elite Test 360 has been clinically proven to: 
					
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li class="ico-1">
						Enhance athletic performance and strength
					</li>
					<li class="ico-2">
						Pump more blood into muscles by expanding veins and capillaries

					<li class="ico-4">

					</li>
					<li class="ico-5">
						Have positive sexual side effects
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
<p>Although we maintained a healthy level of skepticism we could not wait to find out for ourselves if these supplements could do everything they claimed. The combination of Ripped Muscle X with Elite Test 360 was a common thread among success stories we had heard. The idea is that Ripped Muscle X will help you gain energy for for stronger muscle-building lifts while the amino acid supplement Elite Test 360 will take off the hard to lose fat by boosting testosterone and allowing your body to burn calories more efficiently.</p>

              <p><strong>WEEK 1:</strong>
              </p><p>After 1 week on the new routine, I was surprised by how fast and dramatic the effects were. My energy level was up and I wasn't as hungry as usual. The appetite curbing was a welcome side effect of the amino acids in Elite Test 360. I felt fantastic and best of all, I didn't have to change anything about my daily routine.</p>
              <p>On Day 7, I got on the scale and used a caliper to check my body fat. I couldn't believe my eyes--I had gained 4 lbs of lean muscle mass in my first week!</p>

              <p>But still I wasn't completely convinced. I know that in the beginning of many muscle programs, you lose a lot of water weight without producing a lasting effect on actual body composition. I wanted to see if I could continue to gain this much muscle in upcoming weeks. But I was certainly excited-I now weighed under 13 stones for the first time in years!</p>

              <p><strong>WEEK 2:</strong>
              </p><p>After 2 weeks of using both supplements I had more energy than ever. The detoxifying properties of Ripped Muscle X were allowing me to sleep through through the night every night, maximizing recovery and growth time for my muscles. I also managed to lose another 6 lbs of fat, and started to see the outline of my 6-pack coming back which of course my girlfriend loved. After just 14 days I was feeling quite confident that these products were the real deal.</p>

              <p><strong>WEEK 3:</strong>
              </p><p>After 3 weeks, all my doubts and skepticisms had vanished! I had gained 12 lbs of lean muscle and had lost a total of 14 lbs of fat. All the fat on the sides of my stomach was completely gone and my 6-pack was becoming even more defined. These products are just amazing. Gaining this much muscle while simultaneously losing fat felt completely unreal!</p>
              <p>I maintained my sky-high energy levels as well. Usually around the third week of other programs I would start to run out of steam and start gaining back some of the weight which I later learned was simply the water weight I had lost in the first place.</p>

              <p>But with Ripped Muscle X and Elite Test 360 my energy levels didn't dip. Instead, they remained steady throughout the day!</p>

I gained an unbelievable 16 lbs of lean muscle mass since starting the Ripped Muscle X and Elite Test 360 routine! Everyone at FSN has been scouring the net to get their hands on free trials of these products now. In week 4 I lost 6 more lbs of fat, putting my body fat percentage into the single digits! I was ready and confident for the fitness competition. I am definitely going to continue taking Ripped Muscle X and Elite Test 360 because they produce consistent, amazing results.</p>
