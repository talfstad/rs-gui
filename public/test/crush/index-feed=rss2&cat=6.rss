				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend, Paris Photo Los Angeles <a href="http://www.parisphoto.com/losangeles" target="_blank">touches down</a> at Paramount Pictures Studios, bringing 79 exhibitors from 17 countries to Paramount’s sound stages and New York Street Backlot.</p>
<p>Highlights of the event, now in its third iteration, include vintage Polaroids by Guy Bourdin at Louise Alexander, new large-format works by Ralph Gibson at Etherton Gallery, a new series by Juergen Teller at Suzanne Tarasieve Gallery, as well as a number of never-before-seen historic works.</p>
<p>But it’s not all about the artwork itself: “We present a fair that is a meeting place for professionals, artists, collectors and amateurs that also happens to be in one of the most mythic places in the world,” says Director Florence Bourgeois.</p>
<p>So why decamp to Southern California? “L.A., and Hollywood in particular, has a long history with image-based art, both moving and still,” says Bourgeois. “The artistic scene is alive and people—students, artists, curators, dealers or collectors—are attracted to L.A. to become a part of it.”</p>
<p>To that end, Bourgeois provided <em>T+L </em>a few of her favorite places to check out art in Los Angeles:</p>
<p>1. From a taxi window and over your shoulder. “L.A. attracts some of the best street artists in the world. Art is all around you in L.A.”</p>
<p>2. West Hollywood’s contemporary <a href="http://oh-wow.com/" target="_blank">OHWOW</a> Gallery, currently exhibiting Diana Al-Hadid’s site-specific sculpture, made from materials like fiberglass, steel, plaster, and gold leaf.</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.acmelosangeles.com/" target="_blank">ACME</a>, where Iva Gueorguieva’s sculptures made of soapground on fabric and welded steel are on display.</p>
<p>4. The greats: Getty, LACMA, The Hammer, and The Annenberg Space for Photography, all of which are partnered with Paris Photo Los Angeles.</p>
<p>5. Private homes throughout L.A. “If you are lucky enough to be invited behind closed doors, L.A. residents have some of the most unique collections in the world.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time ever, the Smithsonian is letting children sleep over in the National Portrait Gallery—in addition to its scheduled “Smithsonian Sleepover” nights in the National Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of American History.</p>
<p>Basically these overnight excursions are the perfect opportunity for any kid to live out their <em>Night at the Museum </em>dreams—minus (one would hope) the actual stampedes and revived mummies. The National Portrait Gallery will be open to children ages 10-15, while the National Museum of Natural History and National Museum of American History are open to kids ages 8-12.</p>
<p>The overnights, which run from 7 p.m. to 8:45 a.m. the next day, run from May through August. Here’s the breakdown of what kids can expect on their overnight adventures:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smithsoniansleepovers.org/portrait-gallery/index.shtm" target="_blank"><strong>National Portrait Gallery Sleepover</strong></a><strong> &#8211; </strong>Attendees will create their own artistic portfolios to display in a one-night-only gallery. <em>Dates: </em>Saturday, July 25; August 22</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smithsoniansleepovers.org/natural-history/index.shtm" target="_blank"><strong>Museum of Natural History Sleepover</strong></a><strong> &#8211; </strong>Kids will watch <em>Jean-Michel Cousteau’s Secret Ocean</em> in 3D, partake in games, puzzles, and exhibition-themed crafts, and snooze beneath the Phoenix—the museum’s resident North American Whale. <em>Dates: </em>Friday, May 15; Saturday, June 13; Friday, June 26; Friday, July 3.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smithsoniansleepovers.org/american-history/index.shtm" target="_blank"><strong>National Museum of American History Sleepover</strong></a><strong> – </strong>Kids attending this evening of mystery solving are tasked with finding out how six museum objects have gone missing. Through various games, experiments, craft projects, and more, kids will collect clues and solve the crime before rolling out their sleeping bags. <em>Dates: </em>Saturday, May 30; Saturday, July 18; Saturday, August 1; Friday, August 7; Friday, August 14; Friday, August 28.</p>
