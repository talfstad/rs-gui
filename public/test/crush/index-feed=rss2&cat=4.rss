				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For beauty junkies, TSA liquid restrictions bring on the unwanted packing ritual of checking fluid cosmetics for size compliance (it’s 3.4 fluid ounces or less, by the way). Thankfully, the appropriately named <a href="https://stowawaycosmetics.com/" target="_blank">Stowaway Cosmetics</a>solves such makeup bag woes. The line launched in February of this year, and includes creamy beauty balms, defining mascara, and bold lip colors sold strictly in portable packaging—a boon for makeup-donning jetsetters and commuters alike.</p>
<p>Customers have the option of buying products individually <em>($10-$22)</em> or creating their own custom kit <em>($75),</em> comprised of six essential items. The thoughtfully formulated makeup touts high quality ingredients without the bad stuff (like parabens and phthalate), while a direct-to-consumer model eliminates sticker shock. Better yet, the sleek minimalist packaging makes those refillable plastic bottles seem oh so passé.</p>

		<title>Should You Be Worried About Wearing Shapewear? Good news: Spanx won&#8217;t kill you. But some shapewear and compression garmets, like waist training corsets, could compromise your health</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://www.shape.com/blogs/fit-famous/jessica-alba-wore-corset-3-months-get-her-post-baby-body-back">Jessica Alba</a> and <a href="http://www.shape.com/blogs/fit-famous/kim-kardashian-wears-corset-skinny-down-wedding">Kim Kardashian</a>’s prominent endorsements of “waist-training” corsets to Meb Keflezighi’s memorable display of compression socks when he won the 2014 Boston Marathon, garments that squeeze and cinch are trendier than ever.</p>
<p>But whether you’re after the smoothing effects of Spanx, the supposed weight-loss benefits of a corset, or the believed performance payoffs of compression workout gear, you may want to listen up.</p>
<p>Doctors warn that there are “real health risks to wearing extra-tight clothing for prolonged periods,” according to a new <a href="http://www.latimes.com/health/mind-body/la-he-spanx-danger-20150418-story.html" target="_blank"><em>LA Times</em></a> report. The dangers of too-tight clothing range from<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/meralgia-paresthetica/basics/definition/con-20030852" target="_blank">meralgia paresthetica</a>, a condition characterized by burning nerve pain in the thighs (most common in pregnant women and people who gain weight quickly), to <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/basics/definition/con-20025201" target="_blank">gastroesophageal reflux disease</a>—a chronic digestive disease caused by pressure on internal organs which pushes acid backwards from the stomach into the esophagus. Other <a href="http://www.shape.com/lifestyle/beauty-style/7-health-dangers-hiding-your-closet/slide/6" target="_blank">serious health issues</a> like blood clots, back pain, and difficulty breathing are also a possibility. (Be sure to check out more <a href="http://www.shape.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-strategies/wearing-corset-secret-weight-loss" target="_blank">dangers of wearing a corset for weight loss</a>.)</p>
<p>Oh, and to up the ick factor, since women are more likely to avoid the bathroom while donning spandex, there’s also an increased risk for urinary tract infections, as well as an increased risk of yeast infections and skin irritation which can occur from sweating in tight compression gear.</p>
<p>But doctors <em>aren&#8217;t </em>saying you need to ditch your favorite compression gear and shapewear all together. The same doctors from the <em>LA Times </em>said most of these problems go away quickly when clothing pressure is off, so there’s no harm in wearing compression garments for short periods of time if they give you a perceived boost. And, hey, if elite athletes like Meb swear by them there must be some payoff, right?!</p>
<p>Well, studies are mixed when it comes to speed, but <a href="http://www.shape.com/fitness/cardio/verdict-behind-5-popular-running-tools/slide/2" target="_blank">research suggests</a> that runners who wear compression gear do experience reduced muscle soreness, as well as lower levels of blood lactate (a measure of lactic acid and exercise intensity), which could translate to a speedier recovery. Even if the research is still inconclusive, there&#8217;s certainly anecdotal evidence. “They increase blood flow, which speeds the rate at which you can rid your body of waste products,”<a href="http://www.shape.com/lifestyle/mind-and-body/your-speedy-workout-recovery-schedule/slide/3http://www.shape.com/lifestyle/mind-and-body/your-speedy-workout-recovery-schedule/slide/3" target="_blank">said</a> Tom Holland, a Connecticut-based exercise physiologist and triathlete who regularly wears compression garments.</p>
<p>So, go ahead, wear your favorite spandex or <a href="http://www.shape.com/lifestyle/workout-clothes-gear/your-guide-compression-running-gear" target="_blank">compression workout gear</a>, just be sure to remove immediately post-workout so you don&#8217;t fall victim to any of these rather unpleasant side effects. And for your own good, just stay away from waist training corsets!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s no end to the splendor of wearing yoga pants. All. The. Time. They’re as comfy as all get out. They don’t cut into your belly or leave seam marks down your thighs. They make your butt look ah-mazing.</p>
<p>And according to a <a href="http://www.ejcr.org/Curations/Curations-PDFs/Curations12/Curation12-3.pdf" target="_blank">Harvard Business School study</a>, when you wear them outside of the gym, they make you look like a woman to be taken seriously. It all comes down to attitude: as in, appearing as if you are too cool to fit the status quo.</p>
<p>In fact, the researchers write that wearing gym clothes in, say, a luxury boutique can lead others to perceive you as more well-to-do. “It’s been found that under certain conditions, nonconforming behaviors, such as not following the expected dress code or the appropriate professional conduct in a given context, can signal higher status,” they write. “When the deviant behavior appears to be deliberate, it can lead to higher status inferences rather than lower ones.”</p>
<p>Is there anything yoga pants <em>can&#8217;t</em> do??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Celebrities have certainly capitalized on their growing popularity. Always-fashionable starlets such as Jennifer Lopez, Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, and Reese Witherspoon are regularly spotted out and about in their workout wear, looking like they&#8217;re super chic and super chill all at the same time. Some even have their own “athleisure” lines. Kate Hudson has Fabletics; Carrie Underwood, <a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/style/calia-by-carrie-underwood" target="_blank">Calia</a>. Beyoncé has partnered with Top Shop.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, big-name, high-end designers like Stella McCartney, Cynthia Rowley, Hood by Air, and Heidi Klum have their own activewear lines. $500 for a pair of Alexander Wang track pants? Why not? You can basically wear them 24/7.</p>
<p>In 2013 alone, <a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/yoga-pants" target="_blank">yoga participation</a> increased by 4.5 percent, but yoga wear sales increased by 45 percent.</p>
<p>Gap, which also owns Banana Republic, Old Navy, and Athleta, is hoping to use that to its advantage. As Gap retail sales steadily decline, the company is moving away from denim and toward spandex.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/style/article/Athleta-s-Nancy-Green-designs-for-women-on-the-6222191.php" target="_blank"><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></a> noted in an interview published today with Athleta president Nancy Green that while Gap is closing down its trendy online retail website Piperlime, it&#8217;s opening more and more Athleta stores. Women are willing to invest in yoga pants and stretchy tops like they used to invest in designer jeans and high heels. &#8220;We’re not just making clothes you work out in,&#8221; Green told the <a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/style/article/Athleta-s-Nancy-Green-designs-for-women-on-the-6222191.php" target="_blank"><em>Chronicle</em></a>, &#8220;but also clothes you can wear to work and look great in throughout your day.&#8221;</p>
