				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="tagline">This secret ingredient can help you score smoother skin, brighter teeth, and healthier-looking nails.</h3>
<p>Our bodies contain the same concentration of minerals and nutrients as sea water, so it’s no wonder that sea salt is a natural ally to balance, protect, and restore the body and skin.</p>
<p>One of the major differences between sea salt and ordinary salt is the mineral content: Sea salt is laden with minerals, including magnesium, calcium, sodium, and potassium, all of which play a key role in our skin&#8217;s health, function, and cellular communication. When your skin&#8217;s mineral balance is off-kilter, symptoms such as dryness, dullness, irritation, and blotchiness ensue, especially as the colder, dryer weather sets in. Bringing sea salt from the kitchen into your beauty routine can help balance and improve hydration, strengthen the protective barrier of our skin, and kick-start the cell-to-cell communication signals that slow down with age.</p>
<p><strong>1. Balancing Mask</strong><br />
Both salt and honey have anti-inflammatory properties to soothe skin and calm breakouts and irritation. They also help to balance oil production and retain hydration in the layers of skin where it&#8217;s needed most.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix two teaspoons sea salt (preferably finely ground) with four teaspoons raw honey to create a spreadable paste. Apply evenly to clean, dry skin, avoiding eye area. Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. Before rinsing, soak a washcloth in very warm water, and gently wring out. Lay the warm washcloth on your face for 30 seconds. Use your fingers to gently exfoliate in a circular motion while rinsing your skin thoroughly with tepid water. Follow with your usual skin-care routine.</p>
<p><strong>2. Oil-Sapping Facial Toner</strong><br />
Salt helps to cleanse pores deeply, balance oil production and thwart bacteria that can instigate breakouts and acne.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix one teaspoon sea salt with four ounces of warm water in small spray bottle until salt is dissolved. Mist on clean, dry skin, avoiding eyes. Use daily or twice daily.</p>
<p><strong>3. Softening Body Scrub</strong><br />
Salt is a gentle natural exfoliate that sloughs off dead skin. It also has minerals to soften skin and restore hydration.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix a quarter-cup salt and a half-cup olive oil or softened <a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/coconut-oil" target="_blank">coconut oil</a> into a thick paste. If desired, add 10 drops of your favorite <a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/essential-oils-uses" target="_blank">essential oil</a>. Apply in the shower with a washcloth, loofah, or the palms of your hands, gently scrubbing your skin in a circular motion.</p>
<p><strong>4. Rejuvenating Scrub</strong><br />
Salt is a skin-softening exfoliant that restores skin. Aloe vera hydrates, heals, and aids skin cell turnover, while lavender is a natural antiseptic that increases circulation.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix together a half-cup salt, a quarter-cup pure aloe vera juice or gel, a quarter-cup oil (your choice!), one tablespoon dried lavender flowers, and 10 drops essential oil of lavender. The resulting mixture should form a thick paste; if it&#8217;s too dry, add a few extra drops of oil. Apply in the shower with a washcloth, loofah, or the palms of your hands, gently scrubbing your skin in a circular motion.</p>
<p><strong>5. Relaxing Salt Bath</strong><br />
Salt absorbs dirt, grime, and toxins and cleanses your skin&#8217;s pores deeply. Salt&#8217;s mineral content helps restore the protective barrier in skin and helps it hold hydration. You may notice that your skin won&#8217;t wrinkle or prune after a good, long soak in salted water, which is evidence that a salt bath helps your skin retain its moisture. The magnesium in sea salt may also help reduce water retention (i.e., bloating) in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Try it: </strong>Add one-third cup salt to a tub filled with warm water, and swish to dissolve the salt. Soak for 15 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>6. Anti-Dandruff Scalp Treatment</strong><br />
Salt helps loosen and remove existing flakes while stimulating circulation for a healthy scalp. The ingredient also absorbs excess oil and moisture to prevent fungal growth and inhibit the root of dandruff.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Part your hair a few times, and sprinkle one to two teaspoons of salt on your scalp. Using wet fingers, massage your scalp gently and thoroughly for 10 to 15 minutes (if you can recruit someone to do this for you, it is very relaxing!). Wash and condition your hair with your favorite products. The results will be immediate.</p>
<p><strong>7. Teeth Whitener</strong><br />
Salt and <a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/baking-soda" target="_blank">baking soda</a> are both gentle abrasives that will help remove stains and brighten teeth. Salt also contains a natural source of fluoride, which is a bonus for your teeth and gums.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix one teaspoon salt and two teaspoons baking powder. Dip a damp toothbrush in the mixture, and brush teeth normally. If the taste is too intense, try putting a dab of toothpaste on the brush before dipping it in the mixture.</p>
<p><strong>8. Natural Mouth Wash</strong><br />
Salt acts as a disinfectant to kill the bacteria that can cause bad breath and gingivitis.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix together a half-teaspoon salt, a half-teaspoon baking soda, and a quarter-cup water until the salt dissolves. Swish the solution around in your mouth and between teeth. Spit, then rinse.</p>
<p><strong>9. Nail Brightening Treatment</strong><br />
Salt softens cuticles and skin and strengthens nails. Baking soda and<a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/uses-for-lemons" target="_blank">lemon</a> work to reduce yellowing and stains for brighter, healthier-looking nails.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix one teaspoon salt, one teaspoon baking soda, one teaspoon lemon juice, and a half-cup warm water in a small bowl. Soak nails in the solution for 10 minutes, then scrub with a soft brush. Rinse hands, and moisturize.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Move over, kale, blueberries, and salmon: there&#8217;s a new superfood on the health scene. Yerba mate tea is coming in hot (literally).</p>
<p>Native to the subtropics of South America, yerba mate has been an integral part of diet and culture in that part of the world for hundreds of years. In fact, people in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and southern Brazil consume yerba mate just as much as coffee, if not more. &#8220;Many people in South America consume yerba mate on a daily basis,” says Elvira de Mejia, Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana.</p>
<p>Packed with 24 vitamins and minerals—including vitamin A, B, C, and E, as well as calcium, iron, potassium, and zinc—amino acids, and antioxidants, yerba mate is a nutritional powerhouse. This near-magical combination of nutrients means mate packs a big punch. “It can help to increase endurance, aid in digestion, ease the signs of aging, eliminate stress, and relieve insomnia,” says Professor de Mejia.</p>
<p>Evidence even shows that mate contributes to weight loss and weight maintenance, according to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18034743" target="_blank">a study</a> published in <em>The Journal of Food Science</em>. This impact on metabolism has given it growing popularity among U.S. athletes in the past few years, including avid users such as U.S. ski racer <a href="https://twitter.com/lalalalaurenne/status/560320493845504000" target="_blank">Laurenne Ross</a>.</p>
<p>But the superfood qualities of yerba mate don’t stop there. Mate also stimulating—a combo that sets it apart from the likes of coffee and green tea. And, while it has a nearly equal caffeine content as coffee, its benefits go far beyond a quick energy boost. Hailed as a brain food, this tea increases attention, focus, and concentration, but doesn’t leave you feeling jittery or anxious after a cup or two. (Add it to our list of <a href="http://www.shape.com/healthy-eating/diet-tips/7-brain-foods-eat-every-day" target="_blank">7 Brain Foods to Eat Every Day</a>!)</p>
<p>Traditionally, yerba mate leaves are served communally in a mate gourd. Mate purists believe that this method allows the person drinking it to effectively receive the healing properties of the leaves, and symbolizes the strength of community. Recent years have brought the commercialization of the yerba, creating versions of the tea that the average person can drink on the go. Companies such as <a href="http://guayaki.com/" target="_blank">Guayaki</a>, one of the first to bring yerba mate to the United States and is sold in Whole Foods stores throughout the country, now offers the tea in a variety of forms and flavors—glass bottles and cans, sparkling versions, and even mate shots (similar to a 5-Hour Energy drink). The company works with local farmers in yerba mate hotspots across Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay to ensure that consumers are getting the real stuff.</p>
<p>But, be warned: Yerba mate on its own might not be the tastiest thing you’ve ever tried to guzzle down for the sake of the health benefits—the distinct flavor has even been said to taste a little grassy. “For maximum health effects, you should buy the leaves and brew them strong in a french press or coffee maker,” says David Karr, co-founder of Guayaki. “But if you can’t handle the taste of the yerba on its own, make a mate latte by adding a little sugar and some almond milk or soy milk.” If buying the leaves feels like a little much, head to the organic section to find pre-packed tea bags or flavored single serving options.</p>
<p>Yerba mate really could be the mightiest of superfoods—bringing you the strength of coffee, the health benefits of tea, and the euphoria of chocolate, all in one mighty punch. So, really, the only question you should have left is why <em>haven&#8217;t </em>you tried it yet?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Healthy eating doesn&#8217;t <em>seem</em>like it should be so difficult, right? Yet, how many of us have opened our fridge only to find that salad we bought moldy and forgotten? It happens. Buying fruits and veggies is an important first step, but preparing and eating them is the <em>real</em> trick. Thankfully, <a href="http://foodpsychology.cornell.edu/OP/CAN_Approach" target="_blank">a new study</a> finds that making just three simple changes can turn all of your good intentions into great meals.</p>
<p>The difference between choosing the apple instead of the apple strudel? &#8220;Healthy eating can be as easy as making the healthiest choice the most convenient, attractive, and normal option,&#8221; Brian Wansink, Ph.D., author of <em>Slim by Design</em> and Director of the Cornell Food and Brand Lab, said in a press release.</p>
<p>Based on their results, researchers came up with the easy-to-remember C.A.N. method: Make healthy foods <strong>c</strong>onvenient, <strong>a</strong>ttractive, and <strong>n</strong>ormal. (And by extension, make junk food inconvenient, unattractive, and abnormal!) Here&#8217;s how you CAN use these three tricks to become a healthier eater today.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Convenient.</strong> When we&#8217;re in a hurry or starving, we&#8217;re more likely to eat whatever is easiest. But you don&#8217;t have to give into the ease of a bag of chips or microwave dinners. Instead, the scientists recommend making healthier options more convenient to see, order, pick up, and consume. Place pre-cut veggies in a container at the front of your fridge, pre-cook a batch of chicken breasts then place them in individual serving containers, or put a bowl of fresh fruit on the table by your door. (Stumped for ideas? Check out <a href="http://www.shape.com/healthy-eating/diet-tips/15-smart-healthy-alternatives-junk-food" target="_blank">15 Smart, Healthy Alternatives to Junk Food</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>2. Attractiv</strong><strong>e.</strong> Pretty food just tastes better—that&#8217;s a scientific fact, according to the Cornell Food Lab. And it&#8217;s no surprise that people prefer to nosh on food that looks appetizing. Attractiveness can be conveyed through a food&#8217;s name, appearance, expectations, and price, says Wansink. While you can&#8217;t change the name of an ugli fruit (yes, that&#8217;s a real thing!), you can buy foods you find appealing. And this may be one instance where it&#8217;s worth it to splash out a few more dollars for the shiniest apples. At home, put healthy food in pretty bowls or on fun platters and pay attention to how you&#8217;re serving yourself—as in, sit down and eat on your nice plates instead of hovering over the pot on the stove.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Normal.</strong> Humans are creatures of habit: We prefer foods that are normal to purchase, order, and eat, according to the study. Essentially, you know what you like and you like what you know. But this doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t broaden your palate to learn to love new foods or healthier versions of favorite foods. The trick is to make it part of your routine. For example, try setting out salad bowls every night at dinner to remind yourself to take some salad.</p>
