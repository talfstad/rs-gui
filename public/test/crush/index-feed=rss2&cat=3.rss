				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marula Oil Is Your New Miracle-Working Beauty Secret<br />
Sorry, coconut.</p>
<p>As much as we love (and religiously use) coconut oil, there&#8217;s a new multi-purpose miracle product that&#8217;s gone mainstream—and it might just be our new favorite.</p>
<p>Marula oil is harvested from the nut inside the sweet marula fruit and has been a hallmark skincare cure-all for the Ovambo women in northern Namibia for centuries. Whether used unrefined on its own or as a key ingredient in a more complicated product, it&#8217;s light in texture, super fast-absorbing, packed with nutrients and fatty acids that fight environmental aggressors, and *amazingly* hydrating.</p>
<p>Basically, it&#8217;s got everything we want in an oil and then some—marula oil contains 60 percent more antioxidants than other oils, even our beloved argan.</p>
<p>Because virtually every industry pro we know sings its praises (and there&#8217;s an influx of new marula products hitting the market), you need to be well-versed in all its beautifying powers. Here&#8217;s what you need to know:</p>
<p>Your Skin<br />
It works for every skin type: From dry to oily to sensitive skin, it&#8217;s always naturally soothing, fast-absorbing, and never leaves a greasy residue.</p>
<p>It balances moisture levels: Whether it&#8217;s used on its own or added to a skin product, a few drops on the face, neck, and décolleté will lock in moisture without leaving a thick residue. Plus, it will fight off free radicals that threaten your complexion. (You can also add a few drops to your foundations so they won&#8217;t be as drying to the skin.)</p>
<p>It softens: It will leave your skin ultra-smooth to the touch in an instant, but just as importantly, it will help maintain that silky texture by hydrating and reversing the damage that left skin rough in the first place. Miracle worker? We say yes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a total anti-ager: It&#8217;s chock full of fatty acids and omega oils, as well as Vitamins E and C, which work together to repair free radical damage, like that from the sun exposure or pollution, which accelerate aging. It&#8217;s been shown to improve skin elasticity and reduce the appearance of fine lines and deep-set wrinkles.</p>
<p>It fights acne, as well as treats blemishes and scars: Thanks to its hydrating and antimicrobial properties, applying it to your problem areas can help reduce the size and appearance of all kinds of blemishes. It can also reduce the appearance of scars and stretch marks.</p>
<p>You Hair<br />
It protects hair from the elements: Whether it&#8217;s the harsh UV rays of the sun or the heat of your curling iron, marula oil will coat your strands against styling or environmental damage thanks to its ultra-rich shield of antioxidant and essential minerals.</p>
<p>It nourishes: From your strands to your scalp, it&#8217;s powerful for moisture retention and restores healthy hair thanks to its laundry list of aforementioned antioxidants.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a frizz-fighter: It seals the cuticle with a satin finish. Plus, the thin consistency allows it to spread easily through the hair.</p>
<p>Your Nails<br />
It strengthens and moisturizes: When added to nail products, marula oil&#8217;s quick-absorbing active ingredients work to fortify fragile, brittle nails and moisturizes the cuticles for a strong and prettier look.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This all-natural ingredient is good for so much more than sweetening up your tea or coffee.</p>
<p>Honey&#8217;s often thought of as a healthier sweetener, but you might be surprised to learn that this ingredient has tons of skin and hair benefits, too. Made by the alchemy of bees collecting nectar, pollen, and resins from flowers, honey can help moisturize, fight aging, and fight bacteria. Plus, it’s loaded with nutrients, antioxidants, and healing compounds. Next time you’re browsing the grocery store shelves, look for raw honey, which hasn&#8217;t been heat-treated or pasteurized; it contains more active phytonutrient antioxidants and enzymes for enhanced benefits. Here are a few ways to put the ingredient to use (sometimes with the help of some other natural ingredients).</p>
<p><strong>1. Moisturizing Mask</strong><br />
Honey is a natural humectant, meaning it draws moisture from the air into the skin and ensures it&#8217;s retained it in the layers where it’s needed most for penetrating, long-lasting hydration.</p>
<p><strong>Try it: </strong>Spread one teaspoon raw honey on clean, dry skin, and let sit for 15-20 minutes. Rinse with tepid water.</p>
<p><strong>2. Pore Cleanser</strong><br />
The enzymes in raw honey clarify skin and keep pores clear and clean. Plus, the antibacterial properties of honey and jojoba or coconut oil also prevent bacterial buildup that can lead to skin imbalances and breakouts.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Stir one tablespoon raw honey with two tablespoons jojoba oil or coconut oil until the mixture is spreadable consistency. Apply to clean, dry skin, and massage gently in a circular motion, avoiding your eye area. Rinse with tepid water.</p>
<p><strong>3. Gentle Exfoliator</strong></p>
<p>Honey is loaded with antioxidants, enzymes, and other nutrients that nourish, cleanse, and hydrate skin. Baking soda, meanwhile, is a gentle natural exfoliator that removes dead skin cells, allowing new cells to emerge for a radiant complexion.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix two tablespoons honey with one tablespoon baking soda. Splash your skin with water, then gently rub the concoction on your face or body in a circular motion. Rinse well.</p>
<p><strong>4. Scar Fader</strong><br />
Honey is said to lighten skin, and its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial compounds help to decrease the appearances of scars and increase healing and tissue regeneration. The hydrating properties of honey and coconut oil or olive oil will also help revive skin cells, while regular, gentle massaging will increase circulation to aid skin recovery and cell turnover.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix one teaspoon raw honey with one teaspoon coconut oil or olive oil. Apply to the affected area, and massage with the tips of your fingers in a circular motion for one to two minutes. Place a hot washcloth over your skin, and let sit until cool. Repeat daily.</p>
<p><strong>5. Acne Treatment</strong><br />
Honey contains antibacterial and antifungal properties that thwart bacteria that can lead to breakouts. Its anti-inflammatory properties will calm redness and irritation.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Apply a dab of raw honey to affected areas, and sit for 10-15 minutes. Rinse with tepid water.</p>
<p><strong>6. Bath Soak</strong><br />
Honey&#8217;s not just hydrating; its antioxidants will repair skin and protect it against oxidative and environmental damage.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix two heaping tablespoons raw honey with one cup hot water until dissolved. Add to a tub of warm water, and soak.</p>
<p><strong>7. Cuticle Moisturizer</strong><br />
Raw honey is loaded with nutrients and enzymes to nourish and heal skin, and it&#8217;s a natural humectant, meaning it draws moisture into the skin. Coconut oil conditions and protects, while the acetic acid in apple cider vinegar softens hard skin and balances pH for healthy growth.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix one teaspoon honey with one teaspoon apple cider vinegar and one teaspoon coconut oil. Rub over each cuticle, and let sit five to 10 minutes, then rinse.</p>
<p><strong>8. Hair Conditioner</strong><br />
The enzymes and nutrients in raw honey give dull hair shine without weighing it down. Coconut oil penetrates the hair shaft to condition and smooth the cuticle and give your strands the luster you crave.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix one tablespoon raw honey with two tablespoons coconut oil. Apply thoroughly to the bottom two-thirds of damp hair, starting at the ends and working up. Let sit for 20 minutes, and rinse well.</p>
<p><strong>9. Shampoo Booster</strong><br />
The humectant properties of honey help regulate and retain moisture in hair, plus honey is said to strengthen hair follicles for healthy growth.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix one teaspoon honey with a dime-sized amount of your favorite shampoo. Wash and lather as normal, and rinse well.</p>
<p><strong>10. Hair Highlighter</strong><br />
The enzyme glucose oxidase in honey slowly releases hydrogen peroxide, an ingredient known to lighten hair color.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix three tablespoons honey with two tablespoon water. Apply to clean, damp hair, and let sit for an hour. Rinse well. Apply weekly for best results.</p>
<p><strong>11. Sunburn Treatment</strong><br />
Honey restores hydration to the deepest layers of sun-exposed skin—and both honey and aloe vera contain powerful anti-inflammatories to calm burned skin and aid recovery.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="article-sub-title">Whether you&#8217;re after gorgeous color, a bombshell blowout, or overall superhealthy locks, stylists know the tricks to get you there. Here, they reveal their top must-try tips.</h2>
<p><strong>1) Find a shampoo that lathers less.</strong> Sudsy doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean clean—sometimes, it means the opposite. Shampoos that lather too much are often overloaded with moisturizing products, which can leave build-up in your hair, making it look and feel dirtier quicker. So opt for a sulfate-free formula.</p>
<p><strong>2) Give your locks a burst of cold.</strong> Before you hop out of the shower, turn the cold water on for a second and quickly rinse it through your strands. It helps seal the cuticle, adding a sleek finish to your locks.</p>
<p><strong>3) Play hot-and-cold as you dry. </strong>When using a round brush to dry your hair in sections, start from the roots and dry all the way to the ends, letting the brush linger at the tips of your strands. Let your hair cool off like this on its own for five seconds, then repeat on another section. Alternating between heat and cool-down time helps set your style, and your blowout will have more body.</p>
<p><strong>4) Do an at-home glaze between color appointments. </strong>Glazes fill holes and rough spots in your hair cuticles, helping smooth your locks and put moisture back into your hair. This keeps your color shiny and bright so it lasts longer and look better. Plus, you can snag an at-home kit from your local drugstore.</p>
<p><strong>5) Use rollers for high-volume. </strong>For sex-kitten lift, blow out your locks until they&#8217;re dry. Then, section off the hair on top of your head—between your temples and all the way back to the crown of your hair. Divide that section into three smaller sections vertically (as if you were making a mohawk), and wrap each in a 2-inch velcro hair roller. Let your hair sit like this for 30 minutes, and then unwrap your strands, lightly comb them out, and spray for hold.</p>
<p><strong>6) Drop the towel. </strong>Keeping wet strands wrapped in a towel for a half-hour as you do your make-up will just cause frizz! The roughness of the cotton forces your hair cuticles open, making them more likely to go every-which-way. Instead, squeeze out excess water as soon as you&#8217;re out of the shower, then let your hair air-dry for five or ten minutes before blowdrying.</p>
<p><strong>7) Apply products 10 minutes before you style. </strong>Whether you&#8217;re curling, straightening, or whatevering, applying product 10 minutes in advance helps it fully absorb into your strands so you get all of its benefits and more bang for your buck.</p>
<p><strong>8) Wrap—don&#8217;t clamp—your hair for quick curls. </strong>When using a curling iron, you don&#8217;t need to fasten your locks to the barrel. Wrap sections around the iron and hold in place for about 10 seconds to score the same soft, sexy curls.</p>
<p><strong>9) Use spray bottles as your new lazy-day BFF.</strong> If you wake up and your locks are totally flat or grungy from the day before, just spray the top layer of your hair until damp, and then use a big barrel roundbrush (2 inches or more) to blow your locks dry. You&#8217;ll score high volume on that top layer, and since it&#8217;s freshly blown out, you&#8217;ll create the illusion of all-over smooth hair.</p>
<p><strong>10) Use dry shampoo a different way.</strong> Instead of waiting until your locks need an dirt-fighting pick-me-up, apply a dab of dry shampoo to your roots immediately after you wash and dry them. Though your hair&#8217;s already clean, the barrier will stave off the debris and oil your strands will collect throughout the day before it hits. Bonus: It also gives you killer volume.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b style="line-height: 1.5;">Tips for Getting Longer,Thicker, Sexier Hair!Take a pill:</b></p>
<p>Models take <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H7GB9G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004H7GB9G&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;linkId=KYTLNMLB7ADUROAU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">biotin</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JPJ2ZS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002JPJ2ZS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;linkId=5DQ7CCI3NORCS7TB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viviscal</a></b> for more luscious hair like it&#8217;s their job. And it kind of is. And it kind of works. Certain supplements really do promote hair growth, and the B vitamin biotin is one of my favorites. You would have to take 5,000 micrograms (some pills contain that amount) a day for about three to six months before you&#8217;d notice a difference.</p>
<p><b>Less is more:</b></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t take that much effort to make all that hair look good. In fact, you can get away with blow-drying just your volumizer-coated roots as long as you mist the ends with a<b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UL0GTK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004UL0GTK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;linkId=DKAQGVASU2CN6LD4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">texturizing spray</a></b>, such as <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XS2IIA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001XS2IIA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;linkId=ZDDVCK4GETRVG6V3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sally Hershberger Glam Waves</a></b>.</p>
<p><b>Prevent split ends in your sleep:</b></p>
<p>Satin and <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NQ7QFLW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00NQ7QFLW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;linkId=EGUXI464DJSDQYUX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">600-thread-count Egyptian-cotton pillowcases</a></b> create less friction than ordinary cotton ones, so your hair will be less likely to tangle or break when you toss and turn. <b>Another option:</b> Tie your hair into a loose loop on the very top of your head with a scarf or scrunchie.</p>
<p><b>Give it a boost:</b></p>
<p>Long hair is heavy. Without a volumizer, the roots will fall flat. After every shampoo, massage an apricot-size dollop of lightweight mousse (we like <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZLZR8A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004ZLZR8A&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;linkId=PS7DZAB5VVGPHFKH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Hydrocream Whip</a></b>) into the roots while they&#8217;re damp to give hair some lift without turning it crunchy even if your hair is thick and you&#8217;ve never needed to use a<b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RS6JTE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002RS6JTE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;linkId=2JVHTEHGFZXBX3RX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">volumizer</a></b> before.</p>
<p><b>Avoid topknots:</b></p>
<p>Sorry, but when you&#8217;ve got a ton of hair, a big knot isn&#8217;t proportional to your face. The ideal spot for a bun or chignon is at the nape of your neck anything in between there and the crown looks matronly.</p>
<p><b>Dry shampoo and dry conditioner:</b></p>
<p>Yes, dry conditioner is a thing and you&#8217;ll be happy that you know about it on day three of a blowout. Your ends start to look dry right around the same time your roots get oily. Spritz a dry conditioner, like <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DHO7X8S/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DHO7X8S&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;linkId=TT2H4DKHZY73VKFC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oribe Soft Dry Conditioner Spray</a></b>, over your length but never the crown, and focus on the ends to make them shiny and soft.</p>
<p>As for dry shampoo, it&#8217;s a lot easier on hair than cleaning the old-school way, which strips away natural oils along with dirt. Mist it on your roots and massage it into your hair with your fingertips. Then do the same thing on the pieces around your face. Long hair is so heavy that it gets weighed down easily, and the <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=dry%20shampoo&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=E4NZOW2BCHWYOO7B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">dry shampoo</a></b> will also add volume.</p>
<p><b>Care for your scals:</b></p>
<p>Scalp treatments may sound clinical (and a little gross), but massaging a serum (like<b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EXPTCQG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00EXPTCQG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;linkId=2YWNRCCMMN25OJJQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kérastase Initialiste</a></b>) or even a shampoo (try <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR898/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007RTR898&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;linkId=FBHBADKJVHEIOGOA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Therapy</a></b>) that contains essential oils, such as avocado and coconut, into your roots a few times a week will nourish the scalp, creating the right foundation for healthier, stronger hair with less breakage.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Essential oils are used in many beauty, hair-care and health recipes because they are extremely beneficial and this doesn’t need a proof. Essential oil can solve all your beauty related problems like acne, pigmentation, tanning, hair fall, blemishes, tiredness, dandruff, roughness, nail discoloration etc. Here are few ways you can use essential oil.</p>
<p><strong><em>1. Face Toner</em></strong>: You can use essential oils as toner. For normal to dry skin, use one drop of geranium essential oil and chamomile essential oil in 50ml of rose water. For oily skin, use 4-5 drops of lavender oil, tea tree oil and sandalwood oil each in 50ml distilled water or rose water. Store this toner in a spray bottle and use it two times a day. This is completely natural and it will make your face glow.</p>
<p><strong><em>2. Bath Oil</em></strong>: For a relaxing, harmonic and balancing bath mix essential; oil into your bath tub and then take a bath. You can use your favorite fragrances for this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hair growth can be a tricky feat for anyone no matter what type of hair you have. Some of us have hair that seems to grow at a turtles pace and takes up to 3 months just to grow an inch, where as some of us have hair that seems to grow overnight! Well, no matter what type of hair you might be dealing with, these tips could help you out! Check out the list below for 6 ways to help your hair grow at a faster rate and have it become long and luscious before you know it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Trim: </strong>It may seem counterproductive to trim hair when you are trying to grow it out. But it has been shown that if you trim your ends every 6 weeks or so it will encourage your hair to grow longer. It will also keep your hair looking healthy by getting rid of dead ends.</li>
<li><b>Drink Water: </b>Like many things, drinking lots of water can help with your overall health and hair growth. Drinking at least 6-8 cups a day will increase the strength of your hair and keep it looking shiny and healthy.</li>
<li><strong>Brush Rules: </strong>You might be surprised to hear that brushing your hair when wet can not only damage hair, it can prevent hair from growing all together. If you must brush hair while wet, use a wide tooth comb to avoid breakage and damage.</li>
<li><strong>Proteins: </strong>We are what we eat right? Well when it comes to our hair this is very true. It’s important to have a high protein intake when trying to grow your hair out as it will keep your hair strong and encourage growth. Make sure to add in high protein vegetables, meat and nuts to your daily diet.</li>
<li><strong>Hair Washing: </strong>To avoid stripping healthy oils away from hair, only wash hair every second or third day. This will help your hair keep its protective layer of oils and helps it grow longer. Using a dry shampoo on non wash days can help refresh the hair and keep it looking great!</li>
<li><strong>Reduce Styling: </strong>The best way for your hair to grow is natural and loose. Avoid tight up do’s that might bring on breakage and try to avoid styling products while growing out hair. This will prevent the hair strands from weakening and will help you grow out hair at a faster rate.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I change my hair <i>a lot</i>.  My husband thinks I am slightly crazy, but I just can’t seem to make up my mind!  I have typically had short hair, but decided to grow it out over the last two years.  After I had my second baby, I don’t know what came over me but I decided to chop it all off!  I am now determined to grow my hair out and found a few tips to help me along the way!</p>
<div><b>1.  Don’t wash your hair everyday.</b>  Washing your hair everyday can strip away protective oils that help keep hair healthy.  Try washing your hair only 3 to 4 times a week.  It may seem oily at first, but your scalp will adjust in no time.  You can also use a dry shampoo to help dry up excess oil.  Wash your hair in colder water to help fight frizz and keep your hair shaft smooth and healthy.</div>
<div><b>2.  Dry your hair with care.</b>  When you get out of the shower, gently squeeze excess water from your hair and pat dry with a soft towel.  Don’t rub or massage wet hair with a towel.  Comb your hair with a wide-toothed comb to work through tangles.  Try to let your hair air dry as much as possible!</div>
<div><b>3.  Style your hair gently.</b>  If you do blow dry your hair, use a cooler setting.  Be sure to always use a thermal protectant on your hair before styling with heat!</div>
<div><b>4.  Avoid chemicals.</b>  Commercial shampoos, conditioners, and styling products contain a lot of chemicals that make hair look good in the short term, but dry it out and damage it in the long term. Choosing healthier products will prevent your hair from getting dull and dry while its growing out.  Use shampoo that doesn’t contain sulfates.  Also avoid conditioning products that contain silicone.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>5.  Eat well.</b>  You are what you eat!  Eating a healthy diet will help hair grow faster, thicker and glossier.  Be sure to get plenty of vitamin B, found in fruits, veggies and nuts to keep hair thick and strong.  Protein is the building block for your hair so eat plenty of meat, fish, legumes and leafy greens.  Omega-3s like salmon, olive oil, nuts and avocados can help keep hair glossy and smooth.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>6.  Drink plenty of water.</b>  Hydrating your body can help hydrate your hair.  Try to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day and avoid drinks that can dehydrate you.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>7.  Take vitamins.</b>  Biotin <i>(5000 mcg a day)</i> promotes healthy skin, hair and nail growth.  Prenatal vitamins are also packed full of folic acid and other nutrients to promote healthy hair and skin.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>8.  Let your hair down.</b>  Avoid hairstyles that are tight and can cause breakage, like tight ponytails or buns.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>9.  Massage your scalp.</b>  Give yourself a scalp massage 2-3 times a week to for 10 minutes to increase blood flow to the scalp and promote hair growth.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>10.  Trim split ends.</b>  It is important to trim your hair when you are growing it out, but only trim when necessary.  It is okay to skip your 6 week trim if your ends are strong and healthy!</div>
<div></div>
<div><i><b>Do you have any tips for growing your hair out?<br />
We would love to hear them!</b></i></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>HAIR GROWTH SECRETS</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>HOW TO MAKE YOUR HAIR GROW!</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5;">Getting your hair to grow can be fairly easy if you follow a few of these simple home remedies for hair growth tips. Even if you aren’t trying to grow your hair applying these tips to your everyday routine will show you ways to help maintain </span><a style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5;" href="http://thisgirlslifeblog.com/tag/healthy-hair" target="_blank">healthy hair</a><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5;">, that is thicker and stronger.</span></p>
<p>1. <strong>Trim your hair!</strong> We all know that hair grows from our roots so trimming it isn’t actually going to make it grow faster. However, it will make for healthy hair. Healthy hair doesn’t break as easy and essentially lose its length. You will want to do this every 6 to 8 weeks. We aren’t talking about a full on cut, just trim off the dead ends. Your hair will also look much better without scraggily dead ends.</p>
<p>2.<strong> Get a warm oil massage!</strong> If you can find a friend or significant other to massage your scalp then all the better. Not only will it help your hair but scalp massages are extremely relaxing. You can even create your own with a mixture of oils such as coconut, olive and jojoba oils. Heat them up (warm not hot) and start massaging. Massage your head for approximately 20 minutes spreading the oil all down your hair and scalp. Once you have finished massaging leave the oil in for another 30 minutes and rinse thoroughly. Also just regular ole shampoo massaging works great to stimulate your scalp when you are washing your hair.</p>
<p>3.<strong> Brush your hair!</strong> Brushing is another great way to stimulate your scalp. Brush your hair a couple of times a day, gently not rough. Never brush when your hair is wet. If you need to brush when wet use a comb.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Eat well!</strong> Your hair will naturally be much healthier if you eat a healthy diet. Eat foods that are rich in protein they are great for your hair like fish, eggs, nuts, chicken, etc.</p>
<p>5.<strong> Hydrate!</strong> On the same concept as eating well you also want to drink lots of water. Drinking water is good for your body period so why wouldn’t it be good for your hair? Get rid of all of those body toxins and it makes your hair stronger. Stronger hair means less breakage, less breakage means longer hair.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Use ACV {<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HJKRARK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00HJKRARK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thgisli03-20&amp;linkId=M6TRCJZH6ODKD5JG">Apple Cider Vinegar</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=thgisli03-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00HJKRARK" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" data-jpibfi-indexer="1" />}!</strong> I have talked about all the great uses of <a href="http://thisgirlslifeblog.com/2014/01/8-health-beauty-uses-for-apple-cider-vinegar.html">apple cider vinegar</a> before. It is true for your hair growth as well. Use 1 part apple cider to 2 parts water mixture to rinse your hair after shampooing. This will stimulate your hair and like we already mentioned hair stimulation makes hair grow much quicker.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Don’t wash your hair everyday!</strong> If your hair tends to get oily quickly like mine then I know sometimes that is hard to do but find you a good <a href="http://thisgirlslifeblog.com/2012/03/review-pssssst-dry-shampoo.html">dry shampoo</a> and space out your washing’s. If you can do it, only wash your hair at most 3 times a week.</p>
<p>8.<strong> Reduce your stress!</strong> I get it, that is easier said than done but stress is a known cause for hair loss. Try <a href="http://thisgirlslifeblog.com/2012/09/tip-tuesday-stress-less-edition-tension-zappers.html">stress relief techniques</a> that you love to keep it under control.</p>
<p>Growing your hair takes a little bit of effort on your part and well a lot of patience too. Your hair won’t grow inches overnight. I wished that I could say that it would but the truth is simple, it won’t.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beauty-boosting Pills</p>
<p>Are you frustrated with dry skin, cracked lips, or dull hair? A supplement could possibly be the answer. But while there’s no shortage of pills on the market, not all of them are created equally. Find out which nutrients have the power to give you younger-looking skin, shinier strands, and stronger nails. Just make sure to check with a doctor before adding any of these supplements to your routine. </p>
<p>Biotin</p>
<p>Found in foods like peanut butter and bananas, biotin is a B vitamin that supports your skin, nerves, digestive tract, and metabolism. Supplements can be used to help reduce hair loss and encourage nail growth. “Individuals with type 2 diabetes should also look into taking a biotin supplement,” says David Bank, MD, director of the Center for Dermatology in Mt. Kisco, N.Y. “Consuming biotin in combination with chromium picolinate [a mineral found in certain foods] may help improve blood sugar levels.” The recommended daily intake of biotin is 35 micrograms a day, which you may already be getting in your diet, Bank says. </p>
<p>Fern Extract</p>
<p>Fern extract has been researched for close to 20 years for its skin-saving abilities. In fact, a recent study found that it provides protection from ultraviolet rays. It can also be used to treat skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, and vitiligo. “Fern extract has been shown to have a noteworthy anti-inflammatory effect on skin tissue,” Bank says. Ask your doctor for proper dosage if you’re interested in taking a supplement. “The dose is based on weight, which correlates with the amount of skin somebody has,” explains Bank. </p>
<p>Iron</p>
<p>“Without iron, your hair can become dull, thin, and dry,” Bank says. “[And] without iron, your nails could become brittle and break easily.” Iron, found in foods including spinach, oysters, and cashews, also helps make your skin glow by activating B vitamins. Soheil Simzar, MD, a clinical instructor of dermatology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and a dermatologist in Santa Monica, Calif., recommends iron supplements only to patients with an iron deficiency. A doctor can do a simple blood test to find out if you’re deficient and help you decide how much iron you need to take. However, &#8220;Too much iron can cause free radical damage to skin structures,&#8221; warns Simzar.</p>
<p>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</p>
<p>Omega-3s found in fatty fish like salmon, sardines, and mackerel, regulate oil production and help keep your skin moist. “They also delay the skin’s aging process to prevent wrinkles,” Bank says. One 2005 study found that EPA, a type of omega-3 found primarily in fish oil, helps block the release of ultraviolet-induced enzymes that eat away at your skin’s collagen, causing lines and sagging skin. What’s more, omega-3s can boost your hair’s shine, prevent your strands from drying out, and keep your scalp from flaking. “The recommended dose to reap the benefits is 600 mg of DHA per day,” Simzar says. However, if you have a history of mood disorders, fish allergies, diabetes, or high blood pressure, check with your doctor first, he advises.</p>
<p>Vitamin C</p>
<p>“Vitamin C can improve hair growth, fight dandruff, stop hair loss, and lead to thicker hair,” while a deficiency can cause split ends, says Bank. A 2013 study found that people who took a vitamin E and C supplement appeared to have less dryness and tighter, brighter skin after four months. When it comes to supplements, how much you should take depends on your gender. Women 19 and older should take 75 mg a day, while men 19 and up should take 19 mg a day, Bank says. “Vitamin C increases the amount of iron that gets absorbed, which can be a problem for people with hemochromatosis, an iron-overload disease,” he explains. </p>
<p>Vitamin E</p>
<p>“Vitamin E, like Vitamin C, is a powerful antioxidant that helps fight free-radical damage that leads to fine lines,” Simzar says. A 2010 study also found that men who took vitamin E supplements grew more hair than those given a placebo. It’s best to take in gel cap form, since vitamin E is fat-soluble, Simzar says. Just be careful: High doses can cause bruising. “I recommend my patients take it as recommended by their primary physicians,” advises Simzar, who notes that the recommended dose for adults is 30IU. Add it to your diet by eating vitamin E-rich foods like avocado, olive oil, and wheat germ.  &#8220;Most or all of this can usually be obtained from your diet,” Simzar says.</p>
