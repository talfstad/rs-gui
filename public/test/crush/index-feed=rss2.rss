				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marula Oil Is Your New Miracle-Working Beauty Secret<br />
Sorry, coconut.</p>
<p>As much as we love (and religiously use) coconut oil, there&#8217;s a new multi-purpose miracle product that&#8217;s gone mainstream—and it might just be our new favorite.</p>
<p>Marula oil is harvested from the nut inside the sweet marula fruit and has been a hallmark skincare cure-all for the Ovambo women in northern Namibia for centuries. Whether used unrefined on its own or as a key ingredient in a more complicated product, it&#8217;s light in texture, super fast-absorbing, packed with nutrients and fatty acids that fight environmental aggressors, and *amazingly* hydrating.</p>
<p>Basically, it&#8217;s got everything we want in an oil and then some—marula oil contains 60 percent more antioxidants than other oils, even our beloved argan.</p>
<p>Because virtually every industry pro we know sings its praises (and there&#8217;s an influx of new marula products hitting the market), you need to be well-versed in all its beautifying powers. Here&#8217;s what you need to know:</p>
<p>Your Skin<br />
It works for every skin type: From dry to oily to sensitive skin, it&#8217;s always naturally soothing, fast-absorbing, and never leaves a greasy residue.</p>
<p>It balances moisture levels: Whether it&#8217;s used on its own or added to a skin product, a few drops on the face, neck, and décolleté will lock in moisture without leaving a thick residue. Plus, it will fight off free radicals that threaten your complexion. (You can also add a few drops to your foundations so they won&#8217;t be as drying to the skin.)</p>
<p>It softens: It will leave your skin ultra-smooth to the touch in an instant, but just as importantly, it will help maintain that silky texture by hydrating and reversing the damage that left skin rough in the first place. Miracle worker? We say yes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a total anti-ager: It&#8217;s chock full of fatty acids and omega oils, as well as Vitamins E and C, which work together to repair free radical damage, like that from the sun exposure or pollution, which accelerate aging. It&#8217;s been shown to improve skin elasticity and reduce the appearance of fine lines and deep-set wrinkles.</p>
<p>It fights acne, as well as treats blemishes and scars: Thanks to its hydrating and antimicrobial properties, applying it to your problem areas can help reduce the size and appearance of all kinds of blemishes. It can also reduce the appearance of scars and stretch marks.</p>
<p>You Hair<br />
It protects hair from the elements: Whether it&#8217;s the harsh UV rays of the sun or the heat of your curling iron, marula oil will coat your strands against styling or environmental damage thanks to its ultra-rich shield of antioxidant and essential minerals.</p>
<p>It nourishes: From your strands to your scalp, it&#8217;s powerful for moisture retention and restores healthy hair thanks to its laundry list of aforementioned antioxidants.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a frizz-fighter: It seals the cuticle with a satin finish. Plus, the thin consistency allows it to spread easily through the hair.</p>
<p>Your Nails<br />
It strengthens and moisturizes: When added to nail products, marula oil&#8217;s quick-absorbing active ingredients work to fortify fragile, brittle nails and moisturizes the cuticles for a strong and prettier look.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This all-natural ingredient is good for so much more than sweetening up your tea or coffee.</p>
<p>Honey&#8217;s often thought of as a healthier sweetener, but you might be surprised to learn that this ingredient has tons of skin and hair benefits, too. Made by the alchemy of bees collecting nectar, pollen, and resins from flowers, honey can help moisturize, fight aging, and fight bacteria. Plus, it’s loaded with nutrients, antioxidants, and healing compounds. Next time you’re browsing the grocery store shelves, look for raw honey, which hasn&#8217;t been heat-treated or pasteurized; it contains more active phytonutrient antioxidants and enzymes for enhanced benefits. Here are a few ways to put the ingredient to use (sometimes with the help of some other natural ingredients).</p>
<p><strong>1. Moisturizing Mask</strong><br />
Honey is a natural humectant, meaning it draws moisture from the air into the skin and ensures it&#8217;s retained it in the layers where it’s needed most for penetrating, long-lasting hydration.</p>
<p><strong>Try it: </strong>Spread one teaspoon raw honey on clean, dry skin, and let sit for 15-20 minutes. Rinse with tepid water.</p>
<p><strong>2. Pore Cleanser</strong><br />
The enzymes in raw honey clarify skin and keep pores clear and clean. Plus, the antibacterial properties of honey and jojoba or coconut oil also prevent bacterial buildup that can lead to skin imbalances and breakouts.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Stir one tablespoon raw honey with two tablespoons jojoba oil or coconut oil until the mixture is spreadable consistency. Apply to clean, dry skin, and massage gently in a circular motion, avoiding your eye area. Rinse with tepid water.</p>
<p><strong>3. Gentle Exfoliator</strong></p>
<p>Honey is loaded with antioxidants, enzymes, and other nutrients that nourish, cleanse, and hydrate skin. Baking soda, meanwhile, is a gentle natural exfoliator that removes dead skin cells, allowing new cells to emerge for a radiant complexion.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix two tablespoons honey with one tablespoon baking soda. Splash your skin with water, then gently rub the concoction on your face or body in a circular motion. Rinse well.</p>
<p><strong>4. Scar Fader</strong><br />
Honey is said to lighten skin, and its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial compounds help to decrease the appearances of scars and increase healing and tissue regeneration. The hydrating properties of honey and coconut oil or olive oil will also help revive skin cells, while regular, gentle massaging will increase circulation to aid skin recovery and cell turnover.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix one teaspoon raw honey with one teaspoon coconut oil or olive oil. Apply to the affected area, and massage with the tips of your fingers in a circular motion for one to two minutes. Place a hot washcloth over your skin, and let sit until cool. Repeat daily.</p>
<p><strong>5. Acne Treatment</strong><br />
Honey contains antibacterial and antifungal properties that thwart bacteria that can lead to breakouts. Its anti-inflammatory properties will calm redness and irritation.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Apply a dab of raw honey to affected areas, and sit for 10-15 minutes. Rinse with tepid water.</p>
<p><strong>6. Bath Soak</strong><br />
Honey&#8217;s not just hydrating; its antioxidants will repair skin and protect it against oxidative and environmental damage.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix two heaping tablespoons raw honey with one cup hot water until dissolved. Add to a tub of warm water, and soak.</p>
<p><strong>7. Cuticle Moisturizer</strong><br />
Raw honey is loaded with nutrients and enzymes to nourish and heal skin, and it&#8217;s a natural humectant, meaning it draws moisture into the skin. Coconut oil conditions and protects, while the acetic acid in apple cider vinegar softens hard skin and balances pH for healthy growth.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix one teaspoon honey with one teaspoon apple cider vinegar and one teaspoon coconut oil. Rub over each cuticle, and let sit five to 10 minutes, then rinse.</p>
<p><strong>8. Hair Conditioner</strong><br />
The enzymes and nutrients in raw honey give dull hair shine without weighing it down. Coconut oil penetrates the hair shaft to condition and smooth the cuticle and give your strands the luster you crave.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix one tablespoon raw honey with two tablespoons coconut oil. Apply thoroughly to the bottom two-thirds of damp hair, starting at the ends and working up. Let sit for 20 minutes, and rinse well.</p>
<p><strong>9. Shampoo Booster</strong><br />
The humectant properties of honey help regulate and retain moisture in hair, plus honey is said to strengthen hair follicles for healthy growth.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix one teaspoon honey with a dime-sized amount of your favorite shampoo. Wash and lather as normal, and rinse well.</p>
<p><strong>10. Hair Highlighter</strong><br />
The enzyme glucose oxidase in honey slowly releases hydrogen peroxide, an ingredient known to lighten hair color.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix three tablespoons honey with two tablespoon water. Apply to clean, damp hair, and let sit for an hour. Rinse well. Apply weekly for best results.</p>
<p><strong>11. Sunburn Treatment</strong><br />
Honey restores hydration to the deepest layers of sun-exposed skin—and both honey and aloe vera contain powerful anti-inflammatories to calm burned skin and aid recovery.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="tagline">This secret ingredient can help you score smoother skin, brighter teeth, and healthier-looking nails.</h3>
<p>Our bodies contain the same concentration of minerals and nutrients as sea water, so it’s no wonder that sea salt is a natural ally to balance, protect, and restore the body and skin.</p>
<p>One of the major differences between sea salt and ordinary salt is the mineral content: Sea salt is laden with minerals, including magnesium, calcium, sodium, and potassium, all of which play a key role in our skin&#8217;s health, function, and cellular communication. When your skin&#8217;s mineral balance is off-kilter, symptoms such as dryness, dullness, irritation, and blotchiness ensue, especially as the colder, dryer weather sets in. Bringing sea salt from the kitchen into your beauty routine can help balance and improve hydration, strengthen the protective barrier of our skin, and kick-start the cell-to-cell communication signals that slow down with age.</p>
<p><strong>1. Balancing Mask</strong><br />
Both salt and honey have anti-inflammatory properties to soothe skin and calm breakouts and irritation. They also help to balance oil production and retain hydration in the layers of skin where it&#8217;s needed most.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix two teaspoons sea salt (preferably finely ground) with four teaspoons raw honey to create a spreadable paste. Apply evenly to clean, dry skin, avoiding eye area. Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. Before rinsing, soak a washcloth in very warm water, and gently wring out. Lay the warm washcloth on your face for 30 seconds. Use your fingers to gently exfoliate in a circular motion while rinsing your skin thoroughly with tepid water. Follow with your usual skin-care routine.</p>
<p><strong>2. Oil-Sapping Facial Toner</strong><br />
Salt helps to cleanse pores deeply, balance oil production and thwart bacteria that can instigate breakouts and acne.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix one teaspoon sea salt with four ounces of warm water in small spray bottle until salt is dissolved. Mist on clean, dry skin, avoiding eyes. Use daily or twice daily.</p>
<p><strong>3. Softening Body Scrub</strong><br />
Salt is a gentle natural exfoliate that sloughs off dead skin. It also has minerals to soften skin and restore hydration.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix a quarter-cup salt and a half-cup olive oil or softened <a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/coconut-oil" target="_blank">coconut oil</a> into a thick paste. If desired, add 10 drops of your favorite <a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/essential-oils-uses" target="_blank">essential oil</a>. Apply in the shower with a washcloth, loofah, or the palms of your hands, gently scrubbing your skin in a circular motion.</p>
<p><strong>4. Rejuvenating Scrub</strong><br />
Salt is a skin-softening exfoliant that restores skin. Aloe vera hydrates, heals, and aids skin cell turnover, while lavender is a natural antiseptic that increases circulation.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix together a half-cup salt, a quarter-cup pure aloe vera juice or gel, a quarter-cup oil (your choice!), one tablespoon dried lavender flowers, and 10 drops essential oil of lavender. The resulting mixture should form a thick paste; if it&#8217;s too dry, add a few extra drops of oil. Apply in the shower with a washcloth, loofah, or the palms of your hands, gently scrubbing your skin in a circular motion.</p>
<p><strong>5. Relaxing Salt Bath</strong><br />
Salt absorbs dirt, grime, and toxins and cleanses your skin&#8217;s pores deeply. Salt&#8217;s mineral content helps restore the protective barrier in skin and helps it hold hydration. You may notice that your skin won&#8217;t wrinkle or prune after a good, long soak in salted water, which is evidence that a salt bath helps your skin retain its moisture. The magnesium in sea salt may also help reduce water retention (i.e., bloating) in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Try it: </strong>Add one-third cup salt to a tub filled with warm water, and swish to dissolve the salt. Soak for 15 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>6. Anti-Dandruff Scalp Treatment</strong><br />
Salt helps loosen and remove existing flakes while stimulating circulation for a healthy scalp. The ingredient also absorbs excess oil and moisture to prevent fungal growth and inhibit the root of dandruff.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Part your hair a few times, and sprinkle one to two teaspoons of salt on your scalp. Using wet fingers, massage your scalp gently and thoroughly for 10 to 15 minutes (if you can recruit someone to do this for you, it is very relaxing!). Wash and condition your hair with your favorite products. The results will be immediate.</p>
<p><strong>7. Teeth Whitener</strong><br />
Salt and <a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/baking-soda" target="_blank">baking soda</a> are both gentle abrasives that will help remove stains and brighten teeth. Salt also contains a natural source of fluoride, which is a bonus for your teeth and gums.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix one teaspoon salt and two teaspoons baking powder. Dip a damp toothbrush in the mixture, and brush teeth normally. If the taste is too intense, try putting a dab of toothpaste on the brush before dipping it in the mixture.</p>
<p><strong>8. Natural Mouth Wash</strong><br />
Salt acts as a disinfectant to kill the bacteria that can cause bad breath and gingivitis.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix together a half-teaspoon salt, a half-teaspoon baking soda, and a quarter-cup water until the salt dissolves. Swish the solution around in your mouth and between teeth. Spit, then rinse.</p>
<p><strong>9. Nail Brightening Treatment</strong><br />
Salt softens cuticles and skin and strengthens nails. Baking soda and<a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/uses-for-lemons" target="_blank">lemon</a> work to reduce yellowing and stains for brighter, healthier-looking nails.</p>
<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Mix one teaspoon salt, one teaspoon baking soda, one teaspoon lemon juice, and a half-cup warm water in a small bowl. Soak nails in the solution for 10 minutes, then scrub with a soft brush. Rinse hands, and moisturize.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="article-sub-title">Whether you&#8217;re after gorgeous color, a bombshell blowout, or overall superhealthy locks, stylists know the tricks to get you there. Here, they reveal their top must-try tips.</h2>
<p><strong>1) Find a shampoo that lathers less.</strong> Sudsy doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean clean—sometimes, it means the opposite. Shampoos that lather too much are often overloaded with moisturizing products, which can leave build-up in your hair, making it look and feel dirtier quicker. So opt for a sulfate-free formula.</p>
<p><strong>2) Give your locks a burst of cold.</strong> Before you hop out of the shower, turn the cold water on for a second and quickly rinse it through your strands. It helps seal the cuticle, adding a sleek finish to your locks.</p>
<p><strong>3) Play hot-and-cold as you dry. </strong>When using a round brush to dry your hair in sections, start from the roots and dry all the way to the ends, letting the brush linger at the tips of your strands. Let your hair cool off like this on its own for five seconds, then repeat on another section. Alternating between heat and cool-down time helps set your style, and your blowout will have more body.</p>
<p><strong>4) Do an at-home glaze between color appointments. </strong>Glazes fill holes and rough spots in your hair cuticles, helping smooth your locks and put moisture back into your hair. This keeps your color shiny and bright so it lasts longer and look better. Plus, you can snag an at-home kit from your local drugstore.</p>
<p><strong>5) Use rollers for high-volume. </strong>For sex-kitten lift, blow out your locks until they&#8217;re dry. Then, section off the hair on top of your head—between your temples and all the way back to the crown of your hair. Divide that section into three smaller sections vertically (as if you were making a mohawk), and wrap each in a 2-inch velcro hair roller. Let your hair sit like this for 30 minutes, and then unwrap your strands, lightly comb them out, and spray for hold.</p>
<p><strong>6) Drop the towel. </strong>Keeping wet strands wrapped in a towel for a half-hour as you do your make-up will just cause frizz! The roughness of the cotton forces your hair cuticles open, making them more likely to go every-which-way. Instead, squeeze out excess water as soon as you&#8217;re out of the shower, then let your hair air-dry for five or ten minutes before blowdrying.</p>
<p><strong>7) Apply products 10 minutes before you style. </strong>Whether you&#8217;re curling, straightening, or whatevering, applying product 10 minutes in advance helps it fully absorb into your strands so you get all of its benefits and more bang for your buck.</p>
<p><strong>8) Wrap—don&#8217;t clamp—your hair for quick curls. </strong>When using a curling iron, you don&#8217;t need to fasten your locks to the barrel. Wrap sections around the iron and hold in place for about 10 seconds to score the same soft, sexy curls.</p>
<p><strong>9) Use spray bottles as your new lazy-day BFF.</strong> If you wake up and your locks are totally flat or grungy from the day before, just spray the top layer of your hair until damp, and then use a big barrel roundbrush (2 inches or more) to blow your locks dry. You&#8217;ll score high volume on that top layer, and since it&#8217;s freshly blown out, you&#8217;ll create the illusion of all-over smooth hair.</p>
<p><strong>10) Use dry shampoo a different way.</strong> Instead of waiting until your locks need an dirt-fighting pick-me-up, apply a dab of dry shampoo to your roots immediately after you wash and dry them. Though your hair&#8217;s already clean, the barrier will stave off the debris and oil your strands will collect throughout the day before it hits. Bonus: It also gives you killer volume.</p>

<p><b>Give it a boost:</b></p>
<p>Long hair is heavy. Without a volumizer, the roots will fall flat. After every shampoo, massage an apricot-size dollop of lightweight mousse (we like <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZLZR8A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004ZLZR8A&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;linkId=PS7DZAB5VVGPHFKH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Hydrocream Whip</a></b>) into the roots while they&#8217;re damp to give hair some lift without turning it crunchy even if your hair is thick and you&#8217;ve never needed to use a<b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RS6JTE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002RS6JTE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;linkId=2JVHTEHGFZXBX3RX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">volumizer</a></b> before.</p>
<p><b>Avoid topknots:</b></p>
<p>Sorry, but when you&#8217;ve got a ton of hair, a big knot isn&#8217;t proportional to your face. The ideal spot for a bun or chignon is at the nape of your neck anything in between there and the crown looks matronly.</p>
<p><b>Dry shampoo and dry conditioner:</b></p>
<p>Yes, dry conditioner is a thing and you&#8217;ll be happy that you know about it on day three of a blowout. Your ends start to look dry right around the same time your roots get oily. Spritz a dry conditioner, like <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DHO7X8S/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DHO7X8S&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;linkId=TT2H4DKHZY73VKFC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oribe Soft Dry Conditioner Spray</a></b>, over your length but never the crown, and focus on the ends to make them shiny and soft.</p>
<p>As for dry shampoo, it&#8217;s a lot easier on hair than cleaning the old-school way, which strips away natural oils along with dirt. Mist it on your roots and massage it into your hair with your fingertips. Then do the same thing on the pieces around your face. Long hair is so heavy that it gets weighed down easily, and the <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=dry%20shampoo&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=E4NZOW2BCHWYOO7B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">dry shampoo</a></b> will also add volume.</p>
<p><b>Care for your scals:</b></p>
<p>Scalp treatments may sound clinical (and a little gross), but massaging a serum (like<b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EXPTCQG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00EXPTCQG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;linkId=2YWNRCCMMN25OJJQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kérastase Initialiste</a></b>) or even a shampoo (try <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR898/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007RTR898&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=worldingreen-20&amp;linkId=FBHBADKJVHEIOGOA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Therapy</a></b>) that contains essential oils, such as avocado and coconut, into your roots a few times a week will nourish the scalp, creating the right foundation for healthier, stronger hair with less breakage.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New <a href="http://www.shape.com/topics/exercises">exercises</a> are great for variety, sure. But by mastering this four-pack of tried-and-true classics—and then mixing and matching them with varying amounts of rest and resistance—you can target almost any fitness goal with just a handful of moves. Here’s how.</p>
<p><strong>The Moves</strong></p>
<p><em>Squat</em><br />
Stand with feet hip-width apart and shoulder blades tucked back and down (imagine trying to tuck them into back pockets). Push hips back and bend knees until thighs are parallel with the floor, keeping chest up, weight in heels, and knees tracking over middle toes. Push through heels to stand back up.<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> Lead the movement with your hips by imagining that you’re pushing a door open behind you with your butt.</p>
<p><em>Bent-Over Row</em><br />
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Hold <a href="http://www.shape.com/topics/dumbbell-exercises">dumbbells</a> in front of thighs, palms facing body. Push hips back and bend forward until back is parallel to the floor, letting the dumbbells hang downward and maintaining a flat back. Pull dumbbells to sides of torso, then lower them to starting position.<br />
<b>Tip:</b> As with the squat, lead the move with your hips by imagining that you’re pushing a door open behind you with your butt.</p>
<p><em>Lateral Lunge</em><br />
Stand with feet just narrower than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward. Hold dumbbells at sides, palms facing in. (To modify, extend arms by sides without dumbbells.) Take a wide step out to the right with right leg, pushing hips back and bending right knee, keeping left leg straight and chest up. Straighten right leg to return to starting position. Repeat on opposite side.<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> As you descend, feel the move through the glute and hamstring of your bent leg—the exercise shouldn’t place all the stress on your knee.</p>
<p><em>Pushup</em><br />
Get in a plank position with hands directly beneath shoulders. Bend elbows, keeping them close to sides, lowering body until chest touches the floor. Press back up to starting position. To modify, place hands on the fifth step of a staircase instead of the floor. When you’re strong enough, move down one step at a time.<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> Think “head to heels, strong as steel”: Tense your core and strive to maintain a straight body line from your shoulders to your feet throughout the move.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Burn Fat</strong></p>
<p><em>The trick:</em> Intervals. Research has shown that 20 minutes of interval work is more effective for fat loss than 40 minutes of slow cardio. Not only do intervals burn more calories than traditional cardio training, they also increase your body&#8217;s ability to torch fat through hormone production. In this workout, Craig Ballantyne of<a href="http://www.turbulencetraining.com/" target="_blank">TurbulenceTraining.com</a> turns the four moves into a high-intensity interval circuit. “Do the exercises in a non-competing sequence, so that the lower body rests while the upper body works and vice versa,” Ballantyne says. “That allows you to work with high intensity and minimal rest and to finish the workout faster.”</p>
<p><em>The workout:</em> Perform each of the four exercises in order, doing as many reps as possible for 45 seconds with 15 seconds rest between exercises. Repeat the entire circuit 3 or 4 more times.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Get Stronger </strong><br />
<em>The trick:</em> Progression. “Don’t get caught up in just increasing reps,” says Shawn Arent, Ph.D., director of the Center for Health and Human Performance at Rutgers University. “You’ve got to find a way to make each rep more difficult.” Doing more and more reps at the same weight builds endurance (and muscle size). But if you’re looking for strength gains, use heavier dumbbells for the lunge and the row. Upgrade the squat to a goblet squat by holding a dumbbell in both hands in front of your chest (like a goblet). And add resistance to pushups by narrowing your hands to target your triceps or by elevating your feet (use the bottom step of a staircase to start).</p>
<p><em>The workout:</em> Do 4 or 5 sets, with 5 or 6 reps per set, of each exercise in any order, resting about 1 minute between sets and exercises. When you can perform 10 reps of any exercise at your current resistance level, increase the resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Finish Your Workout Faster </strong><br />
<em>The trick:</em> Increase work capacity. To build work capacity over time, you can increase the amount of work you do in the same time, or do the same amount of work in less time. Since your goal is the latter, “complete the total number of reps in less time each workout, or decrease rest periods each workout,” says Mike Wunsch, program design specialist at Results Fitness in Santa Clarita, CA.</p>
<p><em>The workout: </em>Perform 10 reps of each exercise in order, noting the time it takes to complete each one. Repeat the entire circuit three or four more times, resting for 60 to 90 seconds between sets. At each subsequent workout, complete the same number of reps but try to beat your time from the last session. Or, decrease the rest period between sets by 10 seconds at each subsequent workout.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Improve Your Running </strong><br />
<em>The trick:</em> Go heavy. “When you run, you can sacrifice quality muscle mass,” says Arent, who works with Rutgers’ soccer teams on staying strong and fast. By lifting heavier weights, “you can maintain the muscle mass that’s needed for optimal performance.” You might think you want endurance training to go with your endurance running, but Arent says your weight workout should accomplish different goals: “You’re trying to counterbalance what running is doing,” he says. “Use weight lifting as an addition, to build strength for maintaining posture, preventing injury, and giving your runs a finishing kick.”</p>
<p><em>The workout:</em> Twice a week, using resistance equivalent to 80 to 85 percent of your one-rep max weight, do 4 sets of 6 to 8 reps of each exercise in any order, resting one or two minutes between sets. (A weight you can lift 8 times with correct form is around 80 percent of your one-rep max, according to the American Council on Exercise.)</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Build a Strong, Flat Stomach</strong><br />
<em>The trick: </em>Add instability. And you don’t need fancy equipment to do it. Just by lifting one foot off the ground during your pushup, “you’re adding a ton of core musculature” into the move, says Arent.</p>
<p><em>The workout:</em> Use any of the protocols described above, but tweak the exercises in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Squat: </strong>Extend your arms overhead through the entire move, keeping your torso upright and arms in line with your ears. This makes the exercise much tougher, so if you were using dumbbells, bring the weight way down or don’t use them.</li>
<li><strong>Pushup:</strong> At the lowest point of the move, before pressing back to starting position, lift one foot a few inches off the floor, keeping your leg straight and shoulders square. Return the foot to the floor at the top of the move. On the next rep, repeat with the opposite foot.</li>
<li><strong>Lateral Lunge:</strong> Raise dumbbells overhead, keeping arms close to ears, through the entire move. Want even more core? Hold a dumbbell in only one hand.</li>
<li><strong>Bent-Over Row:</strong> Before bending over, bend one knee to lift one foot up. Continue as before, but standing on just one leg. Switch feet halfway through set.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Move over, kale, blueberries, and salmon: there&#8217;s a new superfood on the health scene. Yerba mate tea is coming in hot (literally).</p>
<p>Native to the subtropics of South America, yerba mate has been an integral part of diet and culture in that part of the world for hundreds of years. In fact, people in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and southern Brazil consume yerba mate just as much as coffee, if not more. &#8220;Many people in South America consume yerba mate on a daily basis,” says Elvira de Mejia, Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana.</p>
<p>Packed with 24 vitamins and minerals—including vitamin A, B, C, and E, as well as calcium, iron, potassium, and zinc—amino acids, and antioxidants, yerba mate is a nutritional powerhouse. This near-magical combination of nutrients means mate packs a big punch. “It can help to increase endurance, aid in digestion, ease the signs of aging, eliminate stress, and relieve insomnia,” says Professor de Mejia.</p>
<p>Evidence even shows that mate contributes to weight loss and weight maintenance, according to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18034743" target="_blank">a study</a> published in <em>The Journal of Food Science</em>. This impact on metabolism has given it growing popularity among U.S. athletes in the past few years, including avid users such as U.S. ski racer <a href="https://twitter.com/lalalalaurenne/status/560320493845504000" target="_blank">Laurenne Ross</a>.</p>
<p>But the superfood qualities of yerba mate don’t stop there. Mate also stimulating—a combo that sets it apart from the likes of coffee and green tea. And, while it has a nearly equal caffeine content as coffee, its benefits go far beyond a quick energy boost. Hailed as a brain food, this tea increases attention, focus, and concentration, but doesn’t leave you feeling jittery or anxious after a cup or two. (Add it to our list of <a href="http://www.shape.com/healthy-eating/diet-tips/7-brain-foods-eat-every-day" target="_blank">7 Brain Foods to Eat Every Day</a>!)</p>
<p>Traditionally, yerba mate leaves are served communally in a mate gourd. Mate purists believe that this method allows the person drinking it to effectively receive the healing properties of the leaves, and symbolizes the strength of community. Recent years have brought the commercialization of the yerba, creating versions of the tea that the average person can drink on the go. Companies such as <a href="http://guayaki.com/" target="_blank">Guayaki</a>, one of the first to bring yerba mate to the United States and is sold in Whole Foods stores throughout the country, now offers the tea in a variety of forms and flavors—glass bottles and cans, sparkling versions, and even mate shots (similar to a 5-Hour Energy drink). The company works with local farmers in yerba mate hotspots across Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay to ensure that consumers are getting the real stuff.</p>
<p>But, be warned: Yerba mate on its own might not be the tastiest thing you’ve ever tried to guzzle down for the sake of the health benefits—the distinct flavor has even been said to taste a little grassy. “For maximum health effects, you should buy the leaves and brew them strong in a french press or coffee maker,” says David Karr, co-founder of Guayaki. “But if you can’t handle the taste of the yerba on its own, make a mate latte by adding a little sugar and some almond milk or soy milk.” If buying the leaves feels like a little much, head to the organic section to find pre-packed tea bags or flavored single serving options.</p>
<p>Yerba mate really could be the mightiest of superfoods—bringing you the strength of coffee, the health benefits of tea, and the euphoria of chocolate, all in one mighty punch. So, really, the only question you should have left is why <em>haven&#8217;t </em>you tried it yet?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend, Paris Photo Los Angeles <a href="http://www.parisphoto.com/losangeles" target="_blank">touches down</a> at Paramount Pictures Studios, bringing 79 exhibitors from 17 countries to Paramount’s sound stages and New York Street Backlot.</p>
<p>Highlights of the event, now in its third iteration, include vintage Polaroids by Guy Bourdin at Louise Alexander, new large-format works by Ralph Gibson at Etherton Gallery, a new series by Juergen Teller at Suzanne Tarasieve Gallery, as well as a number of never-before-seen historic works.</p>
<p>But it’s not all about the artwork itself: “We present a fair that is a meeting place for professionals, artists, collectors and amateurs that also happens to be in one of the most mythic places in the world,” says Director Florence Bourgeois.</p>
<p>So why decamp to Southern California? “L.A., and Hollywood in particular, has a long history with image-based art, both moving and still,” says Bourgeois. “The artistic scene is alive and people—students, artists, curators, dealers or collectors—are attracted to L.A. to become a part of it.”</p>
<p>To that end, Bourgeois provided <em>T+L </em>a few of her favorite places to check out art in Los Angeles:</p>
<p>1. From a taxi window and over your shoulder. “L.A. attracts some of the best street artists in the world. Art is all around you in L.A.”</p>
<p>2. West Hollywood’s contemporary <a href="http://oh-wow.com/" target="_blank">OHWOW</a> Gallery, currently exhibiting Diana Al-Hadid’s site-specific sculpture, made from materials like fiberglass, steel, plaster, and gold leaf.</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.acmelosangeles.com/" target="_blank">ACME</a>, where Iva Gueorguieva’s sculptures made of soapground on fabric and welded steel are on display.</p>
<p>4. The greats: Getty, LACMA, The Hammer, and The Annenberg Space for Photography, all of which are partnered with Paris Photo Los Angeles.</p>
<p>5. Private homes throughout L.A. “If you are lucky enough to be invited behind closed doors, L.A. residents have some of the most unique collections in the world.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Healthy eating doesn&#8217;t <em>seem</em>like it should be so difficult, right? Yet, how many of us have opened our fridge only to find that salad we bought moldy and forgotten? It happens. Buying fruits and veggies is an important first step, but preparing and eating them is the <em>real</em> trick. Thankfully, <a href="http://foodpsychology.cornell.edu/OP/CAN_Approach" target="_blank">a new study</a> finds that making just three simple changes can turn all of your good intentions into great meals.</p>
<p>The difference between choosing the apple instead of the apple strudel? &#8220;Healthy eating can be as easy as making the healthiest choice the most convenient, attractive, and normal option,&#8221; Brian Wansink, Ph.D., author of <em>Slim by Design</em> and Director of the Cornell Food and Brand Lab, said in a press release.</p>
<p>Based on their results, researchers came up with the easy-to-remember C.A.N. method: Make healthy foods <strong>c</strong>onvenient, <strong>a</strong>ttractive, and <strong>n</strong>ormal. (And by extension, make junk food inconvenient, unattractive, and abnormal!) Here&#8217;s how you CAN use these three tricks to become a healthier eater today.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Convenient.</strong> When we&#8217;re in a hurry or starving, we&#8217;re more likely to eat whatever is easiest. But you don&#8217;t have to give into the ease of a bag of chips or microwave dinners. Instead, the scientists recommend making healthier options more convenient to see, order, pick up, and consume. Place pre-cut veggies in a container at the front of your fridge, pre-cook a batch of chicken breasts then place them in individual serving containers, or put a bowl of fresh fruit on the table by your door. (Stumped for ideas? Check out <a href="http://www.shape.com/healthy-eating/diet-tips/15-smart-healthy-alternatives-junk-food" target="_blank">15 Smart, Healthy Alternatives to Junk Food</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>2. Attractiv</strong><strong>e.</strong> Pretty food just tastes better—that&#8217;s a scientific fact, according to the Cornell Food Lab. And it&#8217;s no surprise that people prefer to nosh on food that looks appetizing. Attractiveness can be conveyed through a food&#8217;s name, appearance, expectations, and price, says Wansink. While you can&#8217;t change the name of an ugli fruit (yes, that&#8217;s a real thing!), you can buy foods you find appealing. And this may be one instance where it&#8217;s worth it to splash out a few more dollars for the shiniest apples. At home, put healthy food in pretty bowls or on fun platters and pay attention to how you&#8217;re serving yourself—as in, sit down and eat on your nice plates instead of hovering over the pot on the stove.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Normal.</strong> Humans are creatures of habit: We prefer foods that are normal to purchase, order, and eat, according to the study. Essentially, you know what you like and you like what you know. But this doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t broaden your palate to learn to love new foods or healthier versions of favorite foods. The trick is to make it part of your routine. For example, try setting out salad bowls every night at dinner to remind yourself to take some salad.</p>
